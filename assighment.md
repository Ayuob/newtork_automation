CN451 Network Programming
Final Project: Network Automation with Python
By doing the tasks of this project, you should learn how to Use telnet and ssh oppranches to configure and communicate with network devices.
the Python to performs simple networking tasks as well as to acquire devices information... In this project, you are asked to develop a network application on a virtual network environment. Also, you are expected to test and save your tests results on output text file. The application requirements
are:
First: Use the network emulator program to build a network scenario (of your choice) to SSH the devices and to perform the scripting (in the following tasks). Do the basic
configurations to make these devices communicate to each other using SSH.
Task 1: manually, create three input text files; one for network devices list (contains name and ip address), one for the login information for each device, and the other for some configuration commands (at least two of your choice) for each device. Now, make your main Python script that read (and validate!!!) information from the text files, then it access each device and apply the corresponding commands on them. One of the important tasks of this script is to check the reachability of each ip address in this
network.
Task 2: in addition to your scripts, let the application extract the routers' CPU utilization value and saving it on an output text file on a real-time manner. Build a graph to show the progress of these CPU values.
Extras: write a program that can configure or extract data from a network device using an APL.
Important Note: You are expected to design your programme in a modular-fashion, so that make
separate .py files that contains some functions and classes you may want to use them in your main
programme by importing them
You need to create and submit a short video (no longer than 3 minutes!!) that shows your working
scenarios (with your voice explaining how your project works) and record your screen including all parts
of the tasks.
10 Marks/Task is given from 10 best-clear-well documented answer to 0 for unattempted task *** Up to 5 extra marks for adding different features to your programm. (up to 25 out of 20 ***The final video should be submitted via classroom by deadline. Make sure of that the name of your video file is properly represent you and your work
